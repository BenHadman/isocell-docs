#### EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive

![](file:///C:/Users/Ben/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image002.gif)In August of 2005, the European Union (EU) implemented the EU WEEE Directive 2002/96/EC and later the WEEE Recast Directive 2012/19/EU requiring Producers of electronic and electrical equipment (EEE) to manage and finance the collection, reuse, recycling and to appropriately treat WEEE that the Producer places on the EU market after August 13, 2005. The goal of this directive is to minimize the volume of electrical and electronic waste disposal and to encourage re-use and recycling at the end of life.

Iota Sciences Ltd has met its national obligations to the EU WEEE Directive by registering in those countries to which Iota Sciences Ltd is an importer. Products bearing the symbol of a strikethrough refuse bin must not be disposed of along with unsorted refuse. Municipalities have set up collection points for this purpose.

To dispose of your isoCell at the end of its useful life, please consult your municipal or local authority concerning facilities available for separate collection of used electronic and electrical equipment.

#### Users outside the European Union

At the end of the isoCell's useful life, please refer to your local waste-management organisation on how to dispose of used electronic and electrical equipment.

1.2 Disposal of FC40^STAR^
--------------------------

Dispose of waste FC40^STAR^ in a permitted industrial-waste facility. Combustion products will include hydrogen fluoride, and the facility must be capable of handling halogenated materials. Empty and clean product containers may be disposed as non-hazardous waste. Consult your specific regulations and service providers to determine available options and requirements. Refer to the FC40 material safety data sheet for more information, which is provided on the iotaSciences website ([https://www.iotasciences.com](https://www.iotasciences.com/).)
