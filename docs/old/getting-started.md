Introduction
============

The isoCell simplifies and automates cloning of single cells, by allowing users
to:

-   Create GRIDs on 60 mm circular dishes

-   Dispense single cells into GRID chambers (following the Poisson
    distribution)

-   Add/remove culture medium to chambers to feed cells

-   Harvest colonies

Safety instructions
===================

Use the **iso**Cell with care, and take the following precautions:

-   Only use the isoCell once you have read and understood this manual; make
    sure this manual is accessible, and that potential users read and understand
    it.

-   Take all precautions recommended for the safe handling and of cells and
    reagents used. For FC40, users should familiarize themselves with its
    material safety data sheet (available on the iotaSciences website at
    [https://www.iotasciences.com)](https://www.iotasciences.com/).

-   Powering the equipment:

    -   Use only with the supplied power cord and transformer.

    -   Connect to a suitable AC mains supply (100–240 V; 50–60 Hz; minimum
        power 1 A).

    -   The switch on the AC mains socket is the disconnect device; it should be
        readily accessible.

-   Avoid subjecting the isoCell to impact and vibration during use and
    transportation.

-   Do not connect cables in ways other than those mentioned in this manual;
    different connections may cause damage and fire.

-   Do not open the isoCell. The device does not contain user-serviceable parts.

-   Do not alter the isoCell in any manner.

-   Do not obstruct the movement of the isoCell’s needle holder, nor the
    syringe-plunger mounts.

-   Only use the isoCell when it is set on top of a safe, flat, and stable
    horizontal surface.

-   If water or other liquids are spilled near the isoCell, safety may be
    compromised; ensure no liquid has been in contact with, or entered into, the
    isoCell.

-   If water or other liquid enters the isoCell, stop using it immediately and
    unplug the power supply. Continued use may cause a fire.

-   If any foreign object enters the isoCell, safety may be compromised. Contact
    iotaSciences for actions or precautions.

-   Shut down the isoCell immediately if it smokes, or produces a strange odour
    or unusual noise; continued use may lead to a fire.

-   Do not autoclave the isoCell, or run the sterilisation cycle of a biosafety
    cabinet with the isoCell inside.

-   The isoCell is designed to work between 15-30 °C (60-85 °F) and 0-50%
    humidity. Operating outside these limits may degrade performance and damage
    the isoCell.

-   All service shall be performed only by personnel authorised by iotaSciences.

Disposal and recycling
======================

Disposal of the isoCell
-----------------------

#### EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive

![](media/5ca63e9dedd02f3e51ee26e7c88ba68d.png)

In August of 2005, the European Union (EU) implemented the EU WEEE Directive
2002/96/EC and later the WEEE Recast Directive 2012/19/EU requiring Producers of
electronic and electrical equipment (EEE) to manage and finance the collection,
reuse, recycling and to appropriately treat WEEE that the Producer places on the
EU market after August 13, 2005. The goal of this directive is to minimize the
volume of electrical and electronic waste disposal and to encourage re-use and
recycling at the end of life.

Iota Sciences Ltd has met its national obligations to the EU WEEE Directive by
registering in those countries to which Iota Sciences Ltd is an importer.
Products bearing the symbol of a strikethrough refuse bin must not be disposed
of along with unsorted refuse. Municipalities have set up collection points for
this purpose.

To dispose of your isoCell at the end of its useful life, please consult your
municipal or local authority concerning facilities available for separate
collection of used electronic and electrical equipment.

#### Users outside the European Union

At the end of the isoCell’s useful life, please refer to your local
waste-management organisation on how to dispose of used electronic and
electrical equipment.

Disposal of FC40STAR
--------------------

Dispose of waste FC40STAR in a permitted industrial-waste facility. Combustion
products will include hydrogen fluoride, and the facility must be capable of
handling halogenated materials. Empty and clean product containers may be
disposed as non-hazardous waste. Consult your specific regulations and service
providers to determine available options and requirements. Refer to the FC40
material safety data sheet for more information, which is provided on the
iotaSciences website (https://www.iotasciences.com.)

![](media/102143736cfe01d59ecd27258fe2b0e6.png)

Disposal of reagents and consumables
------------------------------------

Reagents and consumables (other than FC40STAR) should be discarded in a suitable
biohazard container. Refer to your local waste-management organisation and to
relevant laboratory safety instructions for proper disposal practices.

|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|


>   • 18× 60 mm tissue-culture treated dishes with attached locating rings

-   72× eight-tube PCR strips

-   50× 1.5 ml centrifuge tubes

Installation
------------

The isoCell should be located on a flat, stable surface inside a laminar-flow
hood (biosafety cabinet).

It is assumed a qualified iotaSciences engineer initially installed the
isoCell’s fluid systems. For instructions on replacing the fluid systems, please
see Sections 7.4 and 7.5.

Using the isoCell
-----------------

### The isoCell bed – placement of reagents and materials

The isoCell bed (see Fig. 4.1) is where the workflow of isolating, culturing and
harvesting cells is executed. Figure 4.2 illustrates the correct layout of
reagents and materials.

![](media/5414c503c1229e7d320e9e7ae439e723.jpg)

Figure 4.2: The isoCell bed, showing required layout for a 60 mm dish,
centrifuge tubes and 2x 8-tube

PCR strips (optionally replaced with 2x flat bottom

8-well strips).

![](media/5846b78b69da38e8d20bdacc6c217f9c.png)

The workflow is executed on a 60 mm tissue culture dish (a starter-pack is
supplied). The dish should be placed in the circular station at the centre of
the bed (Fig. 4.2), firmly seated flat on the bottom and oriented such that the
triangle protrusion on the locating ring fits into the station’s triangular
notch.

>   The isoCell bed is equipped with an internal heater which can be turned
>   on/off in the options program (Section 6.6.1).

>   N.B. The heater is NOT intended to hold the dish at 37°C, but to slow
>   cooling when the dish is removed from an incubator.

Six reagents (supplied by the user) should be placed in 1.5 ml centrifuge tubes
(supplied in the starter pack) at 6 defined locations on the bed (Fig. 4.2).
Note that:

-   All 6 reagents may not be required for a particular workflow (e.g.,
    dissociation reagent is not needed when feeding cells). The isoCell provides
    a visual prompt for reagents required by any given workflow.

-   A minimum of 1 ml reagent should be provided in a centrifuge tube at the
    appropriate location.

![](media/102143736cfe01d59ecd27258fe2b0e6.png)

A seventh reagent, FC40STAR, is stored at the rear of the isoCell (Fig. 4.1).

>   Before beginning any program, ensure all centrifuge tubes are open with
>   their lids tucked under the rails (Fig. 4.2); this is essential to prevent
>   obstruction of the needle.

Two empty centrifuge tubes serve as repositories for aqueous and FC40STAR waste
(Fig. 4.1). The isoCell will provide a visual prompt of which waste centrifuge
tubes are required by any given workflow. Ensure that waste tubes are empty!

![](media/5846b78b69da38e8d20bdacc6c217f9c.png)

Cells are harvested from chambers in a GRID into tubes in two 8-tube PCR strips
located at the front of the bed (Fig. 4.2). Optionally, they may be harvested
into two flat bottom 8-well strips. The isoCell will provide a visual prompt
which kind of strips are required. Each tube/well in a strip should be filled
with 120 µl culture medium.

![](media/102143736cfe01d59ecd27258fe2b0e6.png)

### Powering-on

To power-on the isoCell, ensure it is connected to the 24V power supply and
mains (both connecting cables supplied), and press the power button on the top
(Fig. 4.1). The

isoCell now executes a start-up program. Users should always perform this
start-up procedure.

The first message on the touchscreen prompts the user to choose a program
(Section 4.3.3).

### Running programs

The complete cloning workflow (making a GRID, and dispensing, feeding, and
harvesting cells) is executed by running a series of programs encoded by the
isoCell. For instance, the ‘*GRID*’ program creates a GRID on a 60 mm dish, and
the ‘*plate*’ program dispense cells into chambers in a GRID. All programs are
executed from the isoCell’s interactive touchscreen. A stylus (supplied) – which
can be stored on top of the isoCell at the front – can facilitate higher touch
accuracy if required.

The first message on the touchscreen after powering-on prompts the user to
choose a program, and the next to place the correct materials and reagents onto
the isoCell bed (see Section 4.3.1).

![](media/5846b78b69da38e8d20bdacc6c217f9c.png)

>   When providing reagents in centrifuge tubes, the user should fill the tube
>   with 1 ml relevant reagent. When a waste tube is required, the user should
>   ensure it is empty.

![](media/5846b78b69da38e8d20bdacc6c217f9c.png)

>   Many programs require the user to select a username and dish colour. The
>   isoCell supports up to thirty-six users. Under each username the isoCell can
>   simultaneously track up to 9 individual dishes via the dishes’ coloured
>   locating rings (Section \#).

### Powering-off

To power-off the isoCell, first press the on-screen

![](media/e383b1f7521f480f865c5982734d29ea.jpg)

button (located on the left side of the touchscreen). Then select the
‘*shutdown*’ option, which initiates a shutdown. When complete, the isoCell will
indicate that power can be safely switched off. At this point the user should
power-off the isoCell by pressing the power button on top of the isoCell (Fig.
4.1). It is not recommended that users skip the shutdown procedure.

### Restarting

To restart the isoCell, first press the on-screen

![](media/e383b1f7521f480f865c5982734d29ea.jpg)

button (located on the left side of the touchscreen). Then select the
‘*restart*’ option, which initiates a restart into a new

fresh state. It is recommended that when switching users, the new user restarts
the isoCell in this way.

Workflow
========

The isoCell offers a convenient and user-friendly workflow to achieve consistent
and reliable outcomes during single-cell cloning. It enables users to:

1.  Make a GRID, and dispense single cells into chambers (Section 5.1)

2.  Feed single cells as they grow to yield clones (Section 5.2)

3.  Harvest the resulting populations/colonies (Section 5.3)

The isoCell supports up to thirty-six users. Under each username, the software
can track up to 9 dishes after entering the colour of the dish’s locating ring.

Once the isoCell has been powered on, select the appropriate program (Section
4.3.3).

Isolate
-------

Cells are isolated in three stages.

-   The ‘*GRID’* program forms a 256-chamber GRID on a 60 mm tissue-culture
    dish; each chamber is 1.9 x 1.9 mm.

-   The ‘*plate*’ program dispenses 200 nl cell-suspension into each chamber.

-   The user now determines which chambers contain single cells, and uses the
    ‘*input-data*’ program to store which chambers contain single cells and need
    to be supplied with fresh medium in future.

### GRID

A GRID is ‘printed’ by the isoCell on a 60 mm tissue-culture dish with an
attached locating ring (supplied). The dish is covered with a thin skim of
cell-culture media and overlaid with FC40STAR, using one of the protocols that
are available for different dish coatings and cell-culture media that are
available on the iotaSciences’ website
(https://www.iotasciences.com[)](https://www.iotasciences.com/). Place the
prepared dish onto the isoCell bed, and run the ‘*GRID*’ program.

### Plate

Prepare a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube containing a suspension of single cells (5,000
cells/ml). The isoCell will dispense this into chambers in a GRID. The
probability that a chamber contains a single cell is determined by Poisson
statistics, so (on average) 94 of the 256 chambers should contain a single cell.

The centrifuge tube containing cells should NOT be placed onto the bed at the
beginning of the ‘*plate*’ program. Best practice is for the user to agitate the
sample at the isoCell prompt, and then place the centrifuge tube onto the bed.
This helps prevent cells from settling, thus maximising adherence to Poisson
statistics.

![](media/102143736cfe01d59ecd27258fe2b0e6.png)

To increase throughput, up to four dishes with pre-made GRIDs can be plated
sequentially in a single run of the ‘*plate*’ program.

### Input data

Once cells have been plated in chambers, chambers containing single cells need
to be identified and the corresponding GRID-coordinates determined.

This is facilitated through use of the reference stage in which each chamber’s
GRID-coordinate is etched (supplied). Remove the plated dish from the isoCell,
and place it on the reference stage (using the locating ring’s triangle to
orient the dish correctly).

Using your microscope, and a numbering sheet available on the iotaSciences
website (https://www.iotasciences.com), record which chambers contain wanted
single cells on the sheet. Only these chambers will be fed, and resulting
colonies picked, later in the workflow.

![](media/102143736cfe01d59ecd27258fe2b0e6.png)

Once the GRID-coordinates of single cells have been determined, the ‘*input
data*’ program is used to store these coordinates in the isoCell’s memory.
Stages in the program are:

1.  Select ‘*user*’. The user selects their own name (if using the isoCell for
    the first time, they should enter their name here).

2.  Select ‘*colour*’. The user selects the colour of the locating ring attached
    to their dish.

3.  Select ‘chambers’. The user selects coordinates of all chambers containing
    wanted single cells.

4.  Press the

    ![](media/8b0fe119b142573be52edacad395423d.jpg)

    button to save data.

Culture
-------

Two programs are provided for the culture of a single cell as it grows into a
colony: ‘*fill*’ and ‘*feed*’.

### Fill

![](media/5846b78b69da38e8d20bdacc6c217f9c.png)

The ‘*fill*’ program is used to top up each chamber containing a single cell
from 200 nl to 800 nl. The user should only run this program once per dish, and
it should be the first program run after ‘*input data*’.

>   Using a microscope, it is easier to identify a single cell in a chamber
>   containing only 200 nl compared to one containing 800 nl (where dark zones
>   at chamber edges can partially obscure cells). Therefore, single cells are
>   identified in 200 nl. As rapidly-growing cells can exhaust the small volume,
>   extra medium is added.

### Feed

The ‘*feed*’ program removes 800 nl spent medium from each chamber, and adds 800
nl fresh media. The user may run this program as often as they deem suitable to
allow single cells to grow into colonies.

![](media/5846b78b69da38e8d20bdacc6c217f9c.png)

>   As a guide, iotaSciences feeds BHK, CHO, and mouse ES cells every \#, \#,
>   and \# days respectively, and picks colonies after \#, \#, and \# days,
>   respectively.

Harvest
-------

Two programs are provided to pick colonies: ‘*detach*’ and ‘*extract*’. The user
can select up to 16 colonies to harvest in one go.

### Detach

The optional ‘*detach*’ program detaches adherent cells from selected chambers
in the dish; it washes a chamber twice with PBS, and then dispenses 800 nl
dissociation reagent (e.g., trypsin). The user now returns the

dish to the incubator for a suitable time, and monitors cell/colony detachment
with a microscope in the usual way.

### Extract

The ‘*extract*’ program picks colonies from selected chambers. Colonies can
contain non-adherant cells, or adherent ones (after running the ‘*detach*’
program). ‘*Extract*’ delivers each selected colony separately into a tube in a
PCR strip (with either round or flat bottoms) at the front of the bed (Fig.
4.2).

The user must first prepare strips by depositing 120 µl culture medium into each
tube/well.

![](media/102143736cfe01d59ecd27258fe2b0e6.png)

Chamber states
--------------

As a dish progresses through the workflow, its chambers will move through
various states. At any given time, a chamber can have one of 7 states.

The state of each chamber is automatically tracked and stored in the isoCell’s
memory. Each user can track chamber states on up to nine dishes simultaneously
via the dishes’ coloured locating rings.

>   The 7 chamber states are:

![](media/ab8e3075e04d85a19ef7c03366115023.jpg)

>   **Empty** – Chamber is empty. This is the default state. (N.B. a chamber
>   with 0 or ≥2 cells is classed as ‘empty’).

![](media/329d82570e59485f07bf892203a29e26.jpg)

>   **Single-cell, unfilled** – Chamber contains a single cell (or its
>   derivative colony). Chamber volume is 200 nl, indicating that the ‘*fill*’
>   program has not yet filled this dish.

![](media/acbcb8769f9c7c3da9191fa6042eeeaf.jpg)

>   **Single-cell, filled** – Chamber contains a single cell (or its derivative
>   colony). Chamber volume is 800 nl.

![](media/2f889c6c5d00750ad3246c87a0b3bbd9.jpg)

>   **Detached** – Dissociation reagent has been administered to this chamber
>   using the ‘*detach*’ program.

![](media/08bd6d6411412fe5b6d7abdf091fc64c.jpg)

>   **Harvested** – The colony has been harvested from this chamber using the
>   ‘*extract*’ program.

![](media/97f94639d9762af1427b118e641d5eb2.jpg)

>   **Dead** – The cell or colony in this chamber has died, and the user has
>   marked it as dead using the ‘*update data*’ program.

![](media/74f395294dee1976973edcc75be5156e.jpg)

>   **Unknown** – The chamber is in an unknown state. This can happen if, for
>   example, a program is cancelled while operating on the chamber. The
>   ‘*recover*’ program (Section 6.8) can be used to attempt to return such
>   chambers to a known state.

Advanced programs
=================

Move
----

The ‘*move*’ program (‘*more*’ → ‘*move*’) is used to:

-   Control movement of the isoCell’s needle holder. The needle holder can be
    moved forwards/backwards, left/right or up/down using the 6 arrow buttons
    (Fig. 6.1a).

-   To return the needle holder to its home (not-in-use) position, press the
    ‘*reset*’ button (Fig. 6.1a).

-   Control withdrawal or insertion of the plungers in the two syringes. Press
    the ‘*syringes*’ button (Fig. 6.1a), which takes you to 4 buttons on a new
    screen that controls fluid dispensing and jetting (Fig. 6.1b).

Movement step size in Figures 6.1a and 6.1b is set using three buttons. Step
sizes are in millimetres for the needle holder, and microlitres for syringes.
With step size set to 1.00, ‘*move*’ buttons will cause large movements; when
set to 0.01, they cause small movements.

Data
----

The ‘*data*’ program (‘*more*’ → ‘*data*’) enables the user to:

-   Add/remove usernames.

-   Erase data of individual dishes under a chosen username.

![](media/102143736cfe01d59ecd27258fe2b0e6.png)

Reset dispensing
----------------

The ‘*reset dispensing*’ program (‘*more*’ → ‘*reset dispensing*’) is used to
completely flush and refill the dispensing system.

This program may be unable to flush large (\>50 µl) bubbles from the dispensing
syringe. In this case, the dispensing syringe needs to be reinstalled (Section
7.4).

![](media/102143736cfe01d59ecd27258fe2b0e6.png)

>   Users are strongly advised to run immediately the ‘*reset dispensing*’
>   program if another program that uses the dispensing system has aborted
>   prematurely; this ensures all reagents are quickly flushed away to
>   preventing tube fouling.

Reset jetting
-------------

The ‘*reset jetting*’ program (‘*more*’ → ‘*reset jetting*’) is used to
completely flush and refill the jetting system.

Replace
-------

The ‘*replace*’ program (‘*more*’ → ‘*replace*’) guides the user through the
replacement of the dispensing needle and dispensing tube.

Settings
--------

### Options

The ‘*options*’ program (‘*more*’ → ‘*settings*’ → ‘*options*’) allows the user
to:

-   Adjust display screen brightness

-   Adjust brightness of lights

-   Adjust volume

-   Turn bed heater on/off

### Set time

The ‘*set time*’ program (‘*more*’ → ‘*settings*’ → ‘*set time*’) is used to
update the date and time.

Assess
------

The ‘*assess*’ programs (‘*more*’ → ‘*assess*’) enable the user to assess the
growth of sparsely-plated cells using a given culture medium/supplement. Users
fill and feed the entire GRID, without inputting GRID-coordinates of chambers
containing single cells. Using these programs, conditions can be optimised
without adhering to the basic workflow. The programs are:

-   ‘*more*’ → ‘*assess*’ → ‘*fill all*’

>   The ‘*fill all*’ program tops up all 256 chambers from 200 nl to 800 nl.

-   ‘*more*’ → ‘*assess*’ → ‘*feed all*’

>   The ‘*feed all*’ program removes 800 nl spent medium from all 256 chambers,
>   and then adds 800 nl fresh medium.

These programs are analogous to the ‘*culture*’ → ‘*fill*’ and ‘*culture*’ →
‘*feed*’ programs, except they operate on all chambers and not just ones
selected using ‘*input data*’. The ‘*fill all*’ program should be run only once
per dish after plating (as chambers can over-fill and merge). The ‘*feed all*’
program may be run as often as the user deems suitable.

Recover
-------

The ‘*recover*’ program (‘*more*’ → ‘*recover*’) recovers chambers from an
*unknown* state to a *single-cell filled* state (Section 5.4 explains chamber
states).

The program operates on all chambers whose state is unknown. It removes 800 nl
fluid from each chamber, and adds back 800 nl fresh media.

When removing fluid, if an unknown chamber contains less than 800 nl, the
difference is made up by removing a small volume of FC40STAR.

Calibrate
---------

The ‘*calibrate*’ program (‘*more*’ → ‘*calibrate*’) calibrates the dispensing
and jetting needle positions relative to the isoCell bed. It must be used if a
needle has been replaced.

Maintenance
===========

Cleaning
--------

It is recommended the exterior of the isoCell is cleaned regularly, ideally
before and after each use. iotaSciences recommend the use of a damp cloth,
soaked in 70% ethanol, to wipe down the exterior.

![](media/102143736cfe01d59ecd27258fe2b0e6.png)

>   Do not attempt to clean manually the needles, which are delicate and easily
>   damaged. The isoCell programs, if followed correctly, ensure needles are
>   kept clean.

>   Care should be taken to ensure that excessive volumes are not used during
>   cleaning, as any ingress may degrade performance and risk electrical safety.

Refill FC40STAR
---------------

FC40STAR is stored in its bottle at the rear of the isoCell (Fig. 4.1). The
isoCell tracks the level of FC40STAR in this bottle, and prompts the user when a
refill is needed.

To refill the bottle, completely unscrew the two-port cap and top up by
carefully pouring in fresh FC40STAR. Note that it is unnecessary to remove
residual FC40STAR, as its performance does not degrade with time.

Having topped up the bottle, replace the two-port cap. Then use the on-screen
interface to update the stored FC40STAR level on the isoCell. Go to the
‘*refill*’ program (‘*more*’ → ‘*refill*’), and drag the level line to the
correct height. Finally, run the ‘*reset jetting*’ program (Section 6.4) to
flush any air from the jetting system.

![](media/5846b78b69da38e8d20bdacc6c217f9c.png)

Update software
