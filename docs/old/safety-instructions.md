Use the isoCell  with care, and take the following precautions:

- Only use the isoCell once you have read and understood this manual; make sure this manual is accessible, and that potential users read and understand it.

- Take all precautions recommended for the safe handling and of cells and reagents used. For FC40, users should familiarize themselves with its material safety data sheet (available on the iotaSciences website at [https://www.iotasciences.com](https://www.iotasciences.com/)[)](https://www.iotasciences.com/).

- Powering the equipment:

-- Use only with the supplied power cord and transformer.

-- Connect to a suitable AC mains supply (100--240 V; 50--60 Hz; minimum power 1 A).

-- The switch on the AC mains socket is the disconnect device; it should be readily accessible.

- Avoid subjecting the isoCell to impact and vibration during use and transportation.

- Do not connect cables in ways other than those mentioned in this manual; different connections may cause damage and fire.

- Do not open the isoCell. The device does not contain user-serviceable parts.

- Do not alter the isoCell in any manner.

- Do not obstruct the movement of the isoCell's needle holder, nor the syringe-plunger mounts.

- Only use the isoCell when it is set on top of a safe, flat, and stable horizontal surface.

- If water or other liquids are spilled near the isoCell, safety may be compromised; ensure no liquid has been in contact with, or entered into, the isoCell.

- If water or other liquid enters the isoCell, stop using it immediately and unplug the power supply. Continued use may cause a fire.

- If any foreign object enters the isoCell, safety may be compromised. Contact iotaSciences for actions or precautions.

- Shut down the isoCell immediately if it smokes, or produces a strange odour or unusual noise; continued use may lead to a fire.

- Do not autoclave the isoCell, or run the sterilisation cycle of a biosafety cabinet with the isoCell inside.

- The isoCell is designed to work between 15-30 °C (60-85 °F) and 0-50% humidity. Operating outside these limits may degrade performance and damage the isoCell.

- All service shall be performed only by personnel authorised by iotaSciences.
