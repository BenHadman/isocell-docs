Introduction
============

The isoCell greatly simplifies and automates the cloning of single
cells, by allowing users to:

-   Create GRIDs on 60 mm circular dishes

-   Dispense single cells into GRID chambers (following the Poisson
    distribution)

-   Add cell-culture medium to GRID chambers containing single cells,
    exchanging for waste products

-   Harvest cell colonies originating from a single cell

===================

Use the isoCell with care, and take the following precautions:

-   Only use the isoCell once you have read and understood the isoCell
    manual. The manual should be accessible for all users. Make sure
    that each potential user reads and understands it.

-   When using any reagents with the isoCell, users should take such
    suitable precautions as are recommended for the safe handling and
    use of those reagents. For the case of FC40, users should
    familiarities themselves with its material safety data sheet, which
    is available on the iotaSciences website
    ([https://www.iotasciences.com)](https://www.iotasciences.com/).

-   Powering the equipment:

    -   Use only with the supplied Mean Well GST90A24-P1M power supply
        and power cord.

    -   Connect power supply to a suitable AC mains supply with voltage
        in range 100--240 V; 50--60 Hz; minimum power 1 A.

    -   The AC mains socket shall act as the disconnect device and be
        readily accessible.

-   Avoid subjecting the isoCell to impact and vibration, both during
    use and during transportation.

-   Do not connect cables in ways other than those mentioned in this
    manual; different connections may cause damage and fire.

-   Do not open the isoCell. The device does not contain user
    serviceable parts.

-   Do not alter the isoCell in any manner.

Disposal and recycling
======================

Disposal of isoCell
-------------------

#### EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive

![](media/image4.png){width="0.7874026684164479in"
height="1.1203619860017497in"}In August of 2005, the European Union (EU)
implemented the EU WEEE Directive 2002/96/EC and later the WEEE Recast
Directive 2012/19/EU requiring Producers of electronic and electrical
equipment (EEE) to manage and finance the collection, reuse, recycling
and to appropriately treat WEEE that the Producer places on the EU
market after August 13, 2005. The goal of this directive is to minimize
the volume of electrical and electronic waste disposal and to encourage
re-use and recycling at the end of life.

Iota Sciences Ltd has met its national obligations to the EU WEEE
Directive by registering in those countries to which Iota Sciences Ltd
is an importer. Products bearing the symbol of a strikethrough refuse
bin must not be disposed of along with unsorted refuse. The
municipalities have set up collection points for this purpose.

To dispose of your isoCell at the end of its useful life, please consult
your municipal or local authority concerning facilities available for
separate collection of used electronic and electrical equipment.

#### Users outside the European Union

To dispose of your isoCell at the end of its useful life, please refer
to your local waste management organisation for proper disposal
practices for used electronic and electrical equipment.

Disposal of FC40^STAR^
----------------------

Dispose of waste FC40^STAR^ in a permitted industrial waste facility.
Combustion products will include hydrogen fluoride. Facility must be
capable of handling halogenated materials. Empty and clean product
containers may be disposed as non-hazardous waste. Consult your specific
regulations and service providers to determine available options and
requirements. Refer to the FC40 material safety data sheet for more
information, which is provided on the iotaSciences website
[(https://www.iotasciences.com)](https://www.iotasciences.com/).

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

-   72× eight-tube PCR strips

-   50× 1.5 ml centrifuge tubes

Installation
------------

The isoCell should be located on a flat, stable surface inside the
user's laminar flow hood.

It is assumed here that the initial installation of the isoCell's fluid
systems will be carried out by a qualified iotaSciences engineer. For
instructions on the correct installation or replacement of the fluid
systems, please see Sections 7.4 and 7.5.

Using the isoCell
-----------------

### The isoCell bed -- placement of reagents and materials

The isoCell bed (see Figure 4.1) is where the workflow of isolating,
culturing and harvesting cells is executed. An image of the bed is
provided in Figure 4.2, showing the correct layout of reagents and
materials.

> ![](media/image16.jpg){width="5.760001093613298in"
> height="1.9333333333333333in"}

Figure 4.2: The isoCell bed, showing correct layout of 60 mm dish,
centrifuge tubes and 8-tube

PCR strips. (Note that the two 8-tube PCR strips can be optionally
replaced with flat bottom two

8-well strips.)

The workflow is executed on a 60 mm tissue culture dish (supplied). The
dish should be placed in the circular station at the centre of the bed,
as shown in Figure 4.2. It should be seated flat at the bottom of the
station, and oriented such that the triangle of the locating ring lies
within the station's triangular notch.

> ![](media/image17.png){width="5.950051399825022in"
> height="1.5571773840769905in"}The isoCell bed comes equipped with an
> internal heater. The heater will warm any dish that is placed on the
> bed, thereby prolonging the time for which the dish can be safely kept
> out of the incubator. The heater can be turned on or off in the
> options program (see Section 6.6.1).
>
> N.B. the heater is not intended to hold the dish at precisely 37°C.
> Rather, it is intended to elevate the dish temperature above ambient,
> thereby reducing any cooling experienced by the cells.

A total of six reagents are required for the workflow and should be
provided by the user in 1.5 ml centrifuge tubes (supplied) at six
defined locations on the bed, as shown in Figure 4.2. It should be noted
that:

-   Not all six reagents will be required at any given time. For
    example, there is no requirement for dissociation reagent when
    isolating cells. The isoCell will provide a visual prompt prior to
    the start of the program of the reagents required by any given part
    of the workflow.

-   For each required reagent, a minimum of 1 ml of the reagent should
    be provided in a centrifuge tube at the required location.

-   FC40^STAR^ is not stored in a centrifuge tube. This reagent is
    stored in the FC40^STAR^ bottle at the rear of the isoCell (see
    Figure 4.1).

> ![](media/image5.png){width="5.950051399825022in"
> height="0.7269466316710411in"}Ensure all centrifuge tubes are open
> before beginning any program. To prevent obstruction of the needle
> holder, tube lids should be tucked under the rails as shown in Figure
> 4.2.

Two further centrifuge tubes serve as waste repositories, into which the
isoCell disposes of reagents. These are again indicated in Figure 4.2,
where 'aqueous waste' refers to all reagents other than FC40^STAR^. The
isoCell will provide a visual prompt of which waste centrifuge tubes are
required by any given part of the workflow. The user should ensure that
any required waste tubes are empty.

![](media/image17.png){width="5.950051399825022in"
height="0.6723283027121609in"}

Cells are harvested by the isoCell from the 60 mm dish into the two
8-tube PCR strips located at the front of the bed, as shown in Figure
4.2. Optionally the user may choose to harvest into two flat bottom
8-well strips rather than two 8-tube PCR strips. The isoCell will
provide a visual prompt when the PCR or flat bottom strips are required.
The strips should be prepared with 120 ul cell culture medium in each
tube/well.

![](media/image5.png){width="5.950051399825022in"
height="0.6723283027121609in"}

### Powering-on

To power-on the isoCell, first ensure that it is connected to a suitable
mains power socket by the supplied mains power cable and 24 V power
supply. Then press the power button, which is located on the top of the
isoCell (see Figure 4.1).

Upon being powered-on, the isoCell will execute a startup procedure. A
message on the touchscreen will prompt the user to place the correct
materials and reagents onto the isoCell bed (see Section 4.3.1). It is
not recommended that users skip the startup procedure.

### Running programs

The isoCell workflow of isolating, culturing and harvesting cells is
executed by running a series of programs from the isoCell. For instance,
the GRID program will create a GRID on the 60 mm dish, the plate program
will dispense cells into a GRID, etc. All programs are executed from the
isoCell's interactive touchscreen. A stylus is supplied to facilitate
higher touch accuracy when required.

At the beginning of each program, a message on the touchscreen will
prompt the user to place the correct materials and reagents onto the
isoCell bed (see Section 4.3.1). When providing reagents in centrifuge
tubes, the user should fill the tube to a volume of 1 ml with the
relevant reagent. When a waste tube is required, the user should ensure
that the waste tube in question is empty.

> ![](media/image17.png){width="5.950051399825022in"
> height="0.8929932195975503in"}Many programs require the user to select
> a username and dish colour. The isoCell supports up to thirty-six
> users. Under each username the isoCell can simultaneously track up to
> nine individual dishes via the dishes' coloured locating rings.

### Powering-off

To power-off the isoCell, first press the on-screen
![](media/image19.jpg){width="0.14459755030621171in"
height="0.13836504811898512in"} button (located on the left side of the
touchscreen). Then select the shutdown option, which will initiate a
shutdown procedure. At the end of the shutdown procedure, the isoCell
will indicate that power can be safely switched off. At this point the
user should power-off the isoCell by pressing the power button, which is
located on the top of the isoCell (see Figure 4.1). It is not
recommended that users skip the shutdown procedure.

### Restarting

To restart the isoCell, first press the on-screen
![](media/image19.jpg){width="0.14459755030621171in"
height="0.13836504811898512in"} button (located on the left side of the
touchscreen). Then select the restart option, which will initiate a
restart procedure.

The restart procedure will put the isoCell into a fresh state. It is
recommended that when switching users, the new user restarts the isoCell
in this way.

[]{#_Toc24695 .anchor}

Workflow
========

The isoCell offers a convenient and user-friendly workflow to achieve
consistent and reliable outcomes from single cell cloning experiments.
It enables users to:

1.  Isolate single cells (Section 5.1)

2.  Culture and outgrow single cells into populations/colonies (Section
    5.2)

3.  Harvest populations/colonies derived from a single cell (Section
    5.3)

The isoCell supports up to thirty-six users. Furthermore, under each
username the isoCell can simultaneously track up to nine individual
dishes via the dishes' coloured locating rings.

Isolate
-------

Cells are isolated in three stages. First the GRID program is used to
form a 256 chamber GRID on a 60 mm tissue culture dish, with each
chamber measuring 1.9 mm by 1.9 mm.

Second the plate program is used to dispense 200 nl cell-suspension
fluid to each of the GRID's 256 chambers.

Third the input data program is used to store, in the isoCell's memory,
the GRID-coordinates of chambers containing single cells.

### GRID

To form a GRID, the user must first prepare the tissue culture dish.
Take a 60 mm dish with attached locating ring (supplied). Prepare the
petri dish with a coating of cell culture media/supplement formulation,
overlaid with FC40^STAR^. Dish preparation protocols for specific cell
culture media/supplement formulations are available on the iotaSciences
website ([https://www.iotasciences.com)](https://www.iotasciences.com/).
Place the prepared dish onto the isoCell bed, and run the GRID program.

### Plate

To plate cells, the user must first prepare a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube
containing a sample of cell suspension fluid with a dilution ratio of
5000 cells per mililitre. The isoCell will dispense this fluid to the
GRID chambers by running the plate program. The probablity of chambers
containing a single cell is determined by Poisson statistics. A dilution
ratio of 5000 per mililitre maximises this probablity, and leads to (on
average) 94 out of 256 chambers containing a single cell.

Note that the centrifuge tube does not need to be placed onto the
isoCell bed at the beginning of the plate program. Rather, best practice
is for the user to agitate the sample until the isoCell prompts the user
to place the centrifuge tube onto the bed. This helps to prevent the
cells from settling, thus maximising the adherence to Poisson
statistics.

For higher throughput, up to four pre-made GRIDs dishes can be plated
sequentially in a single run of the plate program.

### Input data

Once cells have been plated into chambers, the chambers that contain
single cells need to be identified, and the corresponding
GRID-coordinates need to be determined.

This is facilitated through use of the reference stage (supplied).
Remove the plated dish from the isoCell, and place it on the reference
stage, using the locating ring's triangle to correctly orient the dish.
Each chamber's GRID-coordinate is etched onto the reference stage, so
that a microscope can be used to both identify single cells and
determine the corresponding GRID-coordinates. A numbering sheet is
available on the iotaSciences website ([https://www.
iotasciences.com)](https://www.iotasciences.com/) to help users record
GRID-coordinates.

Once the GRID-coordinates of single cells have been determined, the
input data program is used to store these coordinates in the isoCell's
memory. The stages in the program are as follows:

1.  Select user. User should select their own name. If the user is using
    the isoCell for the first time, they will have to enter their name
    at this point.

2.  Select colour. User needs to select the colour of the locating ring
    attached to their dish.

3.  Select chambers. User needs to select all GRID-coordinates that
    correspond to a single cell.

4.  Press the ![](media/image20.jpg){width="0.28951443569553803in"
    height="0.13836286089238845in"} button to save data.

Culture
-------

Two programs are provided for the culturing of single cells into
monoclonal colonies: fill and feed.

### Fill

The fill program is used to top up each chamber containing a single cell
from 200 nl to 800 nl. The user should only run this program once per
dish, and it should be the first program that is run on the dish
following the input data program.

### Feed

The feed program is used to remove 800 nl waste from each monoclonal
chamber, and replace the removed fluid with 800 nl fresh media. The user
may run this program as often as they deem suitable. Through repeated
use of the feed program, single cells will grow into monoclonal
colonies.

Harvest
-------

Two programs are provided for the harvesting of monoclonal colonies:
detach and extract. The user can select up to sixteen colonies to
harvest in one go.

### Detach

The detach program is used to deliver dissociation reagent to the
selected chambers. This program is optional but is required when
harvesting *adherent* cells. It will first wash the chambers twice with
PBS, after which it will dispense 800 nl of dissociation reagent to the
chambers.

Following a run of the detach program, the user should return the dish
to the incubator for a suitable time period to allow the dissociation
reagent to take effect.

### Extract

The extract program is used to remove selected colonies from the dish.
It can be run alone, when using suspension cells, or following a run of
the optional detach program. The extract program will deliver each
selected colony separately into one tube of the two 8-tube PCR strips
located at the front of the bed (see Figure 4.2). Alternatively the user
may replace the two 8-tube PCR strips with two flat bottom

8-well strips.

The user must first prepare the strips by depositing 120 µl cell culture
medium into each tube/well.

![](media/image5.png){width="5.950051399825022in"
height="0.6723283027121609in"}

Chamber states
--------------

As a dish progresses through the workflow, its chambers will move
through various states. At any given time, a chamber can have one of
seven states.

The state of each chamber is automatically tracked and stored in the
isoCell's memory. Each user can track chamber states on up to nine
dishes simultaneously via the dishes' coloured locating rings.

> The seven chamber states are:

The move program (more → move) is used to:

-   Manually move the isoCell's needle holder. The needle holder can be
    moved forwards/backwards, left/right or up/down using the six arrow
    buttons indicated on Figure 6.1a.

> To return the needle holder to its home (not in use) position, press
> the reset button.

-   Manually withdraw or insert the plungers of the ethanol and
    FC40^STAR^ syringes, using the four buttons indicated on Figure
    6.1b.

The movement step size is set using the three buttons indicated in
Figure 6.1. Step sizes are in millimetres for the needle holder and
microlitres for the syringes. With the step size set to 1.00 the move
buttons will cause large movements, whereas with it set to 0.01 the move
buttons will cause small movements.

Reset dispensing
----------------

The reset dispensing program (more → reset dispensing) is used to
completely flush and refill the dispensing system.

The reset dispensing program may be unable to flush large (approximately
50 µl or greater) bubbles from the dispensing syringe. In this case, the
dispensing syringe will need to be reinstalled (see Section 7.4).

> ![](media/image5.png){width="5.950050306211724in"
> height="0.8929932195975503in"}Users are strongly advised to promptly
> run the reset dispening program if a program that uses the dispensing
> system has been aborted prematurely. This will ensure that all
> reagents are quickly flushed from the dispensing system, thus
> preventing fouling of the tube.

Reset jetting
-------------

The reset jetting program (more → reset jetting) is used to completely
flush and refill the jetting system.

Replace
-------

The replace program (more → replace) guides the user through the
replacement of the dispensing needle and dispensing tube. See section
7.4 for more information.

Settings
--------

### Options

The options program (more → settings → options) allows the user to:

-   Adjust display screen brightness

-   Adjust brightness of lights

-   Adjust volume

-   Turn bed heater on or off

### Set time

The set time program (more → settings → set time) is used to update the
date and time on the isoCell.

Assess
------

The assess programs (more → assess) enable the user to assess the
feasibility of outgrowing (sparsely) plated cells using a given cell
culture medium/supplement. Users can fill and feed an entire GRID,
without inputting the GRID-coordinates of chambers containing single
cells. By using these programs, users can pre-optimise growth conditions
for their cells without strictly adhering the tailored single cell
cloning workflow. The programs are:

-   more → assess → fill all

> The fill all program will top up all 256 chambers from 200 nl to 800
> nl.

-   more → assess → feed all

> The feed all program will remove 800 nl waste from all 256 chambers,
> and replace the removed fluid with 800 nl fresh media.

These programs are analagous to the culture → fill and culture → feed
programs, except that they operate on all chambers rather than only
saved monoclonal chambers. The fill all program should be run only once
per dish, after plating. The feed all program may be run as often as the
user deems suitable.

Recover
-------

The recover program (more → recover) is used to recover any chambers
from an *unknown* state to a *single cell filled* state (see Section 5.4
for an explanation of chamber states).

The program will operate on all chambers whose state is unknown. It will
remove 800 nl fluid from each chamber, and replace the removed fluid
with 800 nl fresh media.

When removing fluid, if an unknown chamber contains less than 800 nl,
the program will make up the difference by removing a small volume of
FC40^STAR^ from the dish.

Calibrate
---------

The calibrate program (more → calibrate) is used to calibrate the
dispensing and jetting needle positions relative to the isoCell bed. It
should be used if one of the isoCell's needles has been replaced. In
this case, the new needle will need to be calibrated to ensure continued
performance of the isoCell.

Maintenance
===========

Cleaning
--------

Users are recommended to clean the exterior of the isoCell regularly,
ideally before and after each use. iotaSciences recommend the use of a
damp cloth, soaked in 70% ethanol, to wipe down the exterior.

> ![](media/image5.png){width="5.950051399825022in"
> height="1.550738188976378in"}Do not attempt to manually clean the
> needle holder. Needles are delicate and easily damaged. The isoCell
> programs, if followed correctly, will ensure that needles are kept
> clean.
>
> Care should be taken to ensure that excessive volumes of cleaning
> fluid are not used on the isoCell, as any ingress may lead to degraded
> performance or electrical safety risk.

Refill FC40^STAR^
-----------------

FC40^STAR^ is stored in the FC40^STAR^ bottle, located on the rear of
the isoCell (see Figure 4.1). The isoCell tracks the level of FC40^STAR^
stored in this bottle, and will prompt the user when the bottle needs to
be refilled.

To refill the FC40^STAR^ bottle, completely unscrew the two-port cap
from the bottle. Top up the bottle by carefully pouring fresh FC40^STAR^
into the bottle. Note that it is not necessary to remove any residual
FC40^STAR^ -- its performance does not degrade with time.

Having topped up the bottle, replace the two-port cap. Then use the
on-screen interface to update the stored FC40^STAR^ level on the isoCell
-- drag the level line to the correct height. Finally, run the reset
jetting program (see Section 6.4) to flush any air from the jetting
system.
