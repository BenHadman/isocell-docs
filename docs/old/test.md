User Manual

![image](/pictures/titlepage_companyname.png){width="9cm"}

Introduction
============

The isoCell greatly simplifies and automates the cloning of single
cells, by allowing users to:

-   Create GRIDs on 60 mm circular dishes

-   Dispense single cells into GRID chambers (following the Poisson
    distribution)

-   Add cell-culture medium to GRID chambers containing single cells,
    exchanging for waste products

-   Harvest cell colonies originating from a single cell

Safety instructions
===================

Use the isoCell with care, and take the following precautions:

-   Only use the isoCell once you have read and understood the isoCell
    manual. The manual should be accessible for all users. Make sure
    that each potential user reads and understands it.

-   When using any reagents with the isoCell, users should take such
    suitable precautions as are recommended for the safe handling and
    use of those reagents. For the case of FC40, users should
    familiaries themselves with its material safety data sheet, which is
    available on the iotaSciences website
    ([`https://www.iotasciences.com`](https://www.iotasciences.com)).

-   Powering the equipment:

    -   Use only with the supplied *Mean Well GST90A24-P1M* power supply
        and power cord.

    -   Connect power supply to a suitable AC mains supply with voltage
        in range 100--240 V; 50--60 Hz; minimum power 1 A.

    -   The AC mains socket shall act as the disconnect device and be
        readily accessible.

-   Avoid subjecting the isoCell to impact and vibration, both during
    use and during transportation.

-   Do not connect cables in ways other than those mentioned in this
    manual; different connections may cause damage and fire.

-   Do not open the isoCell. The device does not contain user
    serviceable parts.

-   Do not alter the isoCell in any manner.

-   Do not obstruct the movement of the isoCell's needle holder, nor of
    the syringe plunger mounts.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Installation
------------

The isoCell should be located on a flat, stable surface inside the
user's laminar flow hood.

It is assumed here that the initial installation of the isoCell's fluid
systems will be carried out by a qualified iotaSciences engineer. For
instructions on the correct installation or replacement of the fluid
systems, please see Sections
[7.4](#replace_dispensing){reference-type="ref"
reference="replace_dispensing"} and
[7.5](#replace_jetting){reference-type="ref"
reference="replace_jetting"}.

Using the isoCell
-----------------

### The isoCell bed -- placement of reagents and materials {#bed_chapter}

The isoCell bed (see Figure
[\[key\_components\]](#key_components){reference-type="ref"
reference="key_components"}) is where the workflow of isolating,
culturing and harvesting cells is executed. An image of the bed is
provided in Figure [1](#bed){reference-type="ref" reference="bed"},
showing the correct layout of reagents and materials.

![The isoCell bed, showing correct layout of 60 mm dish, centrifuge
tubes and 8-tube PCR strips. (Note that the two 8-tube PCR strips can be
optionally replaced with flat bottom two 8-well
strips.)[]{label="bed"}](/pictures/getting_started_bed.jpg){#bed}

The workflow is executed on a 60 mm tissue culture dish (supplied). The
dish should be placed in the circular station at the centre of the bed,
as shown in Figure [1](#bed){reference-type="ref" reference="bed"}. It
should be seated flat at the bottom of the station, and oriented such
that the triangle of the locating ring lies within the station's
triangular notch.

+:----------------------------------+:----------------------------------+
| ![image](/pictures/information.png | The isoCell bed comes equipped    |
| ){height="1cm"}                   | with an internal heater. The      |
|                                   | heater will warm any dish that is |
|                                   | placed on the bed, thereby        |
|                                   | prolonging the time for which the |
|                                   | dish can be safely kept out of    |
|                                   | the incubator. The heater can be  |
|                                   | turned on or off in the *options* |
|                                   | program (see Section              |
|                                   | [6.6.1](#options){reference-type= |
|                                   | "ref"                             |
|                                   | reference="options"}).            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | N.B. the heater is not intended   |
|                                   | to hold the dish at precisely     |
|                                   | 37C. Rather, it is intended to    |
|                                   | elevate the dish temperature      |
|                                   | above ambient, thereby reducing   |
|                                   | any cooling experienced by the    |
|                                   | cells.                            |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Six reagents required for the workflow should be provided by the user in
1.5 ml centrifuge tubes (supplied) at six defined locations on the bed,
as shown in Figure [1](#bed){reference-type="ref" reference="bed"}. It
should be noted that:

-   Not all six reagents will be required at any given time. For
    example, there is no requirement for dissociation reagent when
    isolating cells. The isoCell will provide a visual prompt of the
    reagents required by any given part of the workflow.

-   For each required reagent, a minimum of 1 ml of the reagent should
    be provided in a centrifuge tube at the required location.

-   There is a seventh reagent, FC40<sup>STAR</sup>, which is not
    stored in a centrifuge tube. This reagent is stored in the
    FC40<sup>STAR</sup> bottle at the rear of the isoCell (see Figure
    [\[key\_components\]](#key_components){reference-type="ref"
    reference="key_components"}).

  ---------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ![image](/pictures/warning.png){height="1cm"}   Ensure all centrifuge tubes are open before beginning any program. To prevent obstruction of the needle holder, tube lids should be tucked under the rails as shown in Figure [1](#bed){reference-type="ref" reference="bed"}.
  ---------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two further centrifuge tubes serve as waste repositories, into which the
isoCell disposes of reagents. These are again indicated in Figure
[1](#bed){reference-type="ref" reference="bed"}, where 'aqueous waste'
refers to all reagents other than FC40<sup>STAR</sup>. The isoCell will
provide a visual prompt of which waste centrifuge tubes are required by
any given part of the workflow. The user should ensure that any required
waste tubes are empty.

  -------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ![image](/pictures/information.png){height="1cm"}   For instructions on the safe disposal of FC40<sup>STAR</sup>, refer to Section [3.2](#FC40_disposal){reference-type="ref" reference="FC40_disposal"}.
  -------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cells are harvested by the isoCell from the 60 mm dish into the two
8-tube PCR strips located at the front of the bed, as shown in Figure
[1](#bed){reference-type="ref" reference="bed"}. Optionally the user may
choose to harvest into two flat bottom 8-well strips rather than two
8-tube PCR strips. The isoCell will provide a visual prompt when the PCR
or flat bottom strips are required. The strips should be prepared with
120 ul cell culture medium in each tube/well.

  ---------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------
  ![image](/pictures/warning.png){height="1cm"}   Do not put caps on the PCR strips.
  ---------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------

### Powering-on

To power-on the isoCell, first ensure that it is connected to a suitable
mains power socket by the supplied mains power cable and 24 V power
supply. Then press the power button, which is located on the top of the
isoCell (see Figure
[\[key\_components\]](#key_components){reference-type="ref"
reference="key_components"})h.

Upon being powered-on, the isoCell will execute a startup procedure. A
message on the touchscreen will prompt the user to place the correct
materials and reagents onto the isoCell bed (see Section
[4.3.1](#bed_chapter){reference-type="ref" reference="bed_chapter"}). It
is not recommended that users skip the startup procedure.

### Running programs

The isoCell workflow of isolating, culturing and harvesting cells is
executed by running a series of programs from the isoCell. For instance,
the *GRID* program will create a GRID on the 60 mm dish, the *plate*
program will dispense cells into a GRID, etc. All programs are executed
from the isoCell's interactive touchscreen. A stylus is supplied to
facilitate higher touch accuracy when required.

At the beginning of each program, a message on the touchscreen will
prompt the user to place the correct materials and reagents onto the
isoCell bed (see Section [4.3.1](#bed_chapter){reference-type="ref"
reference="bed_chapter"}). When providing reagents in centrifuge tubes,
the user should fill the tube to a volume of 1 ml with the relevant
reagent. When a waste tube is required, the user should ensure that the
waste tube in question is empty.

  -------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ![image](/pictures/information.png){height="1cm"}   Many programs require the user to select a username and dish colour. The isoCell supports up to thirty-six users. Under each username the isoCell can simultaneously track up to nine individual dishes via the dishes' coloured locating rings.
  -------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Powering-off

To power-off the isoCell, first press the on-screen
![image](/pictures/power_off.jpg){height="1em"} button (located on the
left side of the touchscreen). The select the *shutdown* option, which
will initiate a shutdown procedure. At the end of the shutdown
procedure, the isoCell will indicate that power can be safely switched
off. At this point the user should power-off the isoCell by pressing the
power button, which is located on the top of the isoCell (see Figure
[\[key\_components\]](#key_components){reference-type="ref"
reference="key_components"}). It is not recommended that users skip the
shutdown procedure.

### Restarting

To restart the isoCell, first press the on-screen
![image](/pictures/power_off.jpg){height="1em"} button (located on the
left side of the touchscreen). The select the *restart* option, which
will initiate a restart procedure.

The restart procedure will put the isoCell into a fresh state. It is
recommended that when switching users, the new user restarts the isoCell
in this way.

Workflow
========

The isoCell offers a convenient and user-friendly workflow to achieve
consistent and reliable outcomes from single cell cloning experiments.
It enables users to:

1.  Isolate single cells (Section [5.1](#isolate){reference-type="ref"
    reference="isolate"})

2.  Culture and outgrow single cells into populations/colonies (Section
    [5.2](#culture){reference-type="ref" reference="culture"})

3.  Harvest populations/colonies derived from a single cell (Section
    [5.3](#harvest){reference-type="ref" reference="harvest"})

The isoCell supports up to thirty-six users. Furthermore, under each
username the isoCell can simultaneously track up to nine individual
dishes via the dishes' coloured locating rings.

Isolate
-------

Cells are isolated in three stages. First the *GRID* program is used to
form a 256 chamber GRID on a 60 mm tissue culture dish, with each
chamber measuring 1.9 mm by 1.9 mm.

Second the *plate* program is used to dispense 200 nl cell-suspension
fluid to each of the GRID's 256 chambers.

Third the *input data* program is used to store, in the isoCell's
memory, the GRID-coordinates of chambers containing single cells.

### GRID

To form a GRID, the user must first prepare the tissue culture dish.
Take a 60 mm dish with attached locating ring (supplied). Prepare the
petri dish with a coating of cell culture media/supplement formulation,
overlaid with FC40<sup>STAR</sup>. Dish preparation protocols for
specific cell culture media/supplement formulations are available on the
iotaSciences website
([`https://www.iotasciences.com`](https://www.iotasciences.com)).

Place the prepared dish onto the isoCell bed, and run the *GRID*
program.

### Plate

To plate cells, the user must first prepare a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube
containing a sample of cell-suspension fluid with a dilution ratio of
5000 cells per mililitre. The isoCell will dispense this fluid to the
GRID chambers. The probablity of chambers containing a single cell is
determined by Poisson statistics. A dilution ratio of 5000 per mililitre
maximises this probablity, and leads to (on average) 94 out of 256
chambers containing a single cell.

Note that the centrifuge tube does not need to be placed onto the
isoCell bed at the beginning of the *plate* program. Rather, best
practice is for the user to agitate the sample until the isoCell prompts
the user to place the centrifuge tube onto the bed. This helps to
prevent the cells from settling, thus maximising the adherence to
Poisson statistics.

To increase throughput, up to four dishes with pre-made GRIDs can be
plated sequentially in a single run of the plate program.

### Input data {#input_data}

Once cells have been plated into chambers, the chambers that contain
single cells need to be identified, and the corresponding
GRID-coordinates need to be determined.

This is facilitated through use of the reference stage (supplied).
Remove the plated dish from the isoCell, and place it on the reference
stage, using the locating ring's triangle to correctly orient the dish.
Each chamber's GRID-coordinate is etched onto the reference stage, so
that a microscope can be used to both identify single cells and
determine the corresponding GRID-coordinates. A numbering sheet is
available on the iotaSciences website
([`https://www.iotasciences.com`](https://www.iotasciences.com)). to
help users record GRID-coordinates.

Once the GRID-coordinates of single cells have been determined, the
*input data* program is used to store these coordinates in the isoCell's
memory. The stages in the program are as follows:

1.  *Select user*. User should select their own name. If the user is
    using the isoCell for the first time, they will have to enter their
    name at this point.

2.  *Select colour*. User needs to select the colour of the locating
    ring attached to their dish.

3.  *Select chambers*. User needs to select all GRID-coordinates that
    correspond to a single cell.

4.  Press the ![image](/pictures/tick.jpg){height="1em"} button to save
    data.

Culture
-------

Two programs are provided for the culturing of single cells into
monoclonal colonies: *fill* and *feed*.

### Fill

The *fill* program is used to top up each chamber containing a single
cell from 200 nl to 800 nl. The user should only run this program once
per dish, and it should be the first program that is run on the dish
following the *input data* program.

### Feed

The *feed* program is used to remove 800 l waste from each monoclonal
chamber, and replace the removed fluid with 800 l fresh media. The user
may run this program as often as they deem suitable. Through repeated
use of the *feed* program, single cells will grow into monoclonal
colonies.

Harvest
-------

Two programs are provided for the harvesting of monoclonal colonies:
*detach* and *extract*. The user can select up to sixteen colonies to
harvest in one go.

### Detach

The optional *detach* program is used to deliver dissociation reagent to
the selected chambers. It will first wash the chambers twice with PBS,
after which it will dispense 800 nl of dissociation reagent to the
chambers.

It is expected that the user will elect to run the *detach* program when
harvesting *adherent* cells. Following a run of the *detach* program,
the user should return the dish to the incubator for a suitable time
period to allow the dissociation reagent to take effect.

### Extract

The *extract* program is used to remove selected colonies from the dish.
It can be run alone, or following a run of the optional *detach*
program. The *extract* program will deliver each selected colony
separately into one tube of the two 8-tube PCR strips located at the
front of the bed (see Figure [1](#bed){reference-type="ref"
reference="bed"}). Alternatively the user may replace the two 8-tube PCR
strips with two flat bottom 8-well strips.

The user must first prepare the strips by depositing 120 l cell culture
medium into each tube/well.

  ---------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------
  ![image](/pictures/warning.png){height="1cm"}   Do not put caps on the PCR strips.
  ---------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------

Chamber states {#chamber_states}
--------------

As a dish progresses through the workflow, its chambers will move
through various states. At any given time, a chamber can have one of
seven states.

The state of each chamber is automatically tracked and stored in the
isoCell's memory. Each user can track chamber states on up to nine
dishes simultaneously via the dishes' coloured locating rings.

The seven chamber states are:

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ![image](/pictures/chamber_state_empty.png){height="\\ChamberStateFigHeight"}                  **Empty** -- Chamber is empty. This is the default state. (N.B. a non-monoclonal chamber is classed as empty for the purposes of single cell cloning).
  ![image](/pictures/chamber_state_single_cell_unfilled.png){height="\\ChamberStateFigHeight"}   **Single cell unfilled** -- Chamber contains a single cell (or monoclonal colony). Chamber volume is 200 nl, indicating that the *fill* program has not yet been run on this dish.
  ![image](/pictures/chamber_state_single_cell_filled.png){height="\\ChamberStateFigHeight"}     **Single cell filled** -- Chamber contains a single cell (or monoclonal colony). Chamber volume is 800 nl.
  ![image](/pictures/chamber_state_detached.png){height="\\ChamberStateFigHeight"}               **Detached** -- Dissociation reagent has been administered to this chamber using the *detach* program.
  ![image](/pictures/chamber_state_harvested.png){height="\\ChamberStateFigHeight"}              **Harvested** -- The colony has been harvested from this chamber using the *extract* program.
  ![image](/pictures/chamber_state_dead.png){height="\\ChamberStateFigHeight"}                   **Dead** -- The colony in this chamber has died, and the user has marked it as dead using the *update data* program.
  ![image](/pictures/chamber_state_unknown.png){height="\\ChamberStateFigHeight"}                **Unknown** -- The chamber is in an unknown state. This can happen if, for example, a program is cancelled while operating on the chamber. The *recover* program (see Section [6.8](#recover){reference-type="ref" reference="recover"}) can be used to attempt to return these chambers to a known state.
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Advanced programs
=================

Move
----

The *move* program (*more $\rightarrow$ move*) is used to:

-   Manually move the isoCell's needle holder. The needle holder can be
    moved forwards/backwards, left/right or up/down using the six arrow
    buttons indicated on Figure [2](#move1){reference-type="ref"
    reference="move1"}.

    To return the needle holder to its home (not in use) position, press
    the *reset* button.

-   Manually withdraw or insert the plungers of the ethanol and
    FC40<sup>STAR</sup> syringes, using the four buttons indicated on
    Figure [3](#move2){reference-type="ref" reference="move2"}.

The movement step size is set using the three buttons indicated in
Figure [\[move\_interface\]](#move_interface){reference-type="ref"
reference="move_interface"}. Step sizes are in millimetres for the
needle holder and microlitres for the syringes. With the step size set
to 1.00 the move buttons will cause large movements, whereas with it set
to 0.01 the move buttons will cause small movements.

![Needle holder control

![Syringe control
screen[]{label="move2"}](/pictures/MoveScreen2.jpg){#move2}

[\[move\_interface\]]{#move_interface label="move_interface"}

Data
----

The *data* program (*more $\rightarrow$ data*) enables the user to:

-   Add or remove usernames.

-   Erase data of individual dishes under a chosen username.

  ---------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ![image](/pictures/warning.png){height="1cm"}   Removing a username will erase all stored dish data for that username.
  ---------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reset dispensing {#prime_ethanol}
----------------

The *reset dispensing* program (*more $\rightarrow$ reset dispensing*)
is used to completely flush and refill the dispensing system.

The *reset dispensing* program may be unable to flush large
(approximately 50 l or greater) bubbles from the dispensing syringe. In
this case, the dispensing syringe will need to be re-installed (see
Section [7.4](#replace_dispensing){reference-type="ref"
reference="replace_dispensing"}).

  ---------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ![image](/pictures/warning.png){height="1cm"}   Users are strongly advised to promptly run the *reset dispening* program if a program that uses the dispensing system has been aborted prematurely. This will ensure that all reagents are quickly flushed from the dispensing system, thus preventing fouling of the tube.
  ---------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reset jetting {#prime_FC}
-------------

The *reset jetting* program (*more $\rightarrow$ reset jetting*) is used
to completely flush and refill the jetting system.

Replace
-------

The *replace* program (*more $\rightarrow$ replace*) guides the user
through the replacement of the dispensing needle and dispensing tube.

Settings
--------

### Options

The *options* program (*more $\rightarrow$ settings $\rightarrow$
options*) allows the user to:

-   Adjust display screen brightness

-   Adjust brightness of lights

-   Adjust volume

-   Turn bed heater on or off

### Set time

The *set time* program (*more $\rightarrow$ settings $\rightarrow$ set
time*) is used to update the date and time on the isoCell.

Assess
------

The *assess* programs (*more $\rightarrow$ assess*) enable the user to
assess the feasibility of outgrowing (sparsely) plated cells using a
given cell culture medium/supplement. Users can fill and feed the entire
GRID, without inputing the GRID-coordinates of chambers containing
single cells. By using these programs, users can pre-optimise growth
conditions for their cells without strictly adhering the tailored single
cell cloning workflow. The programs are:

-   *more $\rightarrow$ assess $\rightarrow$ fill all*

    The *fill all* program will top up all 256 chambers from 200 l to
    800 l.

-   *more $\rightarrow$ assess $\rightarrow$ feed all*

    The *feed all* program will remove 800 l waste from all 256
    chambers, and replace the removed fluid with 800 l fresh media.

These programs are analagous to the *culture $\rightarrow$ fill* and
*culture $\rightarrow$ feed* programs, except that they operate on all
chambers rather than only saved monoclonal chambers. The *fill all*
program should be run only once per dish, after plating. The *feed all*
program may be run as often as the user deems suitable.

Recover
-------

The *recover* program (*more $\rightarrow$ recover*) is used to recover
any chambers from an *unknown* state to a *single cell filled* state
(see Section [5.4](#chamber_states){reference-type="ref"
reference="chamber_states"} for an explanation of chamber states).

The program will operate on all chambers whose state is unknown. It will
remove 800 l fluid from each chamber, and replace the removed fluid with
800 l fresh media.

When removing fluid, if an unknown chamber contains less than 800 nl,
the program will make up the difference by removing a small volume of
FC40$^\mathsf{STAR}$ from the dish.

Calibrate
---------

The *calibrate* program (*more $\rightarrow$ calibrate*) is used to
calibrate the dispensing and jetting needle positions relative to the
isoCell bed. It should be used if one of the isoCell's needles has been
replaced. In this case, the new needle will need to be calibrated to
ensure continued performance of the isoCell.

Maintenance
===========

Cleaning
--------

Users are recommended to clean the exterior of the isoCell regularly,
ideally before and after each use. iotaSciences recommend the use of a
damp cloth, soaked in 70% ethanol, to wipe down the exterior.

  ---------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ![image](/pictures/warning.png){height="1cm"}   Do not attempt to manually clean the needle holder. Needles are delicate and easily damaged. The isoCell programs, if followed correctly, will ensure that needles are kept clean.
  ---------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ---------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ![image](/pictures/warning.png){height="1cm"}   Care should be taken to ensure that excessive volumes of cleaning fluid are not used on the isoCell, as any ingress may lead to degraded performance or electrical safety risk.
  ---------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Refill FC40<sup>STAR</sup>
---------------------------

FC40$^\mathsf{STAR}$ is stored in the FC40<sup>STAR</sup> bottle,
located on the rear of the isoCell (see Figure
[\[key\_components\]](#key_components){reference-type="ref"
reference="key_components"}). The isoCell tracks the level of
FC40$^\mathsf{STAR}$ stored in this bottle, and will prompt the user
when the bottle needs to be refilled.

To refill the FC40<sup>STAR</sup> bottle, completely unscrew the
two-port cap from the bottle. Top up the bottle by carefully pouring
fresh FC40<sup>STAR</sup> into the bottle. Note that it is not
necessary to remove any residual FC40<sup>STAR</sup> -- its performance
does not degrade with time.

Having topped up the bottle, replace the two-port cap. Then use the
on-screen interface to update the stored FC40<sup>STAR</sup> level on
the isoCell -- drag the level line to the correct height. Finally, run
the *reset jetting* program (see Section
[6.4](#prime_FC){reference-type="ref" reference="prime_FC"}) to flush
any air from the jetting system.

  -------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ![image](/pictures/information.png){height="1cm"}   FC40<sup>STAR</sup> is available to purchase from the iotaSciences website ([`https://www.iotasciences.com`](https://www.iotasciences.com)).
  -------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Update software
---------------

Software update packages can be downloaded from the iotaSciences website
([`https://www.iotasciences.com`](https://www.iotasciences.com)).
Updating requires a computer running either Windows 7 or Windows 10.

  -------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ![image](/pictures/information.png){height="1cm"}   iotaSciences recommend that before updating their isoCell, users:      restart their computer      ensure that no other programs are running
  -------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To update your isocell:

1.  Ensure that the isoCell is powered off. Connect the isoCell to your
    computer using the USB type A -- type B cable (supplied).

2.  Power on the isoCell. Ensure that the isoCell is on the default home
    screen (showing the options *isolate*, *culture*, *harvest* and
    *more*). N.B. the startup procedure may be safely skipped when
    powering on the isoCell for the purposes of updating.

3.  Run the *iotaUpdate.exe* file contained within the update package.

4.  In the window that opens, select*Update isoCell*.

5.  In the next window:

    1.  Enter the serial number of your isoCell. The serial number can
        be found on a label on the rear of the isoCell. It follows the
        format: ICXXXXXXXX

    2.  Specify whether or not you would like to share log data with
        iotaSciences during the update.

    3.  Select *Start* to begin the update. The update will take several
        minutes. Successful completion will be marked by a pop-up window
        displaying *Update completed!*
